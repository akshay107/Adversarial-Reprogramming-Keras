# Keras - Adversarial Reprogramming

This repository contains the Keras implementation of Adversarial Reprogramming paper. In this repository, Inception V3 model is reprogrammed for MNIST classification.

To train the model, run adversarial_reprogramming.py

The trained weights can be downloaded using this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUaoonDEdfseL9F0lFONrEDednB2KUCd/view).

This image is classified as "hammerhead" by Inception V3 model with 0.9041 probability.


The imgs subfolder contains 10 images (one for each MNIST class) of adversarial program which gave the highest class probability.
