# Keras - Adversarial Reprogramming

This repository contains the Keras implementation of Adversarial Reprogramming paper. In this repository, Inception V3 model is reprogrammed for MNIST classification.

To train the model, run adversarial_reprogramming.py

The trained weights can be downloaded using the link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUaoonDEdfseL9F0lFONrEDednB2KUCd/view

The imgs subfolder contains the 10 images (one for each MNIST class) of adversarial program which gave the highest class probability.
